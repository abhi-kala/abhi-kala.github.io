        <h3>What is grid based design ?</h3>
        <p>The grid divides a two-dimensional plane into smaller fields or a three-dimensional space into smaller compartments. The fields or compartments may be the same or different in size. A grid-based design is one that works in and around the constraints of a row-and-column-based grid system to help keep your content cincely aligned. </p>
         <p>Josef Muller Brockmann said that a grid system creates a "sense of compact planning, intelligibility and clarity, and suggest orderliness of design" Grid systems in graphic design, 1981</p>

        <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages ?</h3>
        <p>We live in a interconnected world. This interconnectedness is a result of internet and plethora of digital devices we carry, and these devices come in all shapes and sizes. It is not optional but almost mandatory for the webistes to be responsive these days as most of the people access internet on their mobile devices with varying sizes. </p>

        <h3>Semantic Structure ?</h3>
         <p>Semantics is the study of meaning. It focuses on the relationship between signifiers - like words, phrases, signs, and symbols- and what they stand for, their denotation.
         </p>
         <p>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
         </p>
         <p>Examples of <strong>non-semantic elements</strong>:  "div" and "span" - tells nothing about its content.
         </p>
         <p>Examples of <strong>semantic elements</strong>: "form", "table", and "img" - clearly defines its content.
