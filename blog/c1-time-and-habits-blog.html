        <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try ?</h3>
        <p>I have been a follower of B.J. Fogg for a while and the video given to us in the course material worked as a great reminder for me. I had actually seen that ages ago but it did not click as it clicked this time. I really want to improve my writing, so I have decided to write a few lines around any topic every time I refill my teapot during the day. I use Timeboxing, Pomodoro and meditation in my daily routine. I have found these especially useful while working on multiple projects, especially when there is a chance of too much noise in your mind due to heavy workload.  </p>

        <h3>What did you find interesting ?</h3>
        <p>The most interesting part for me was the fact that these productivity tips were a part of the course material. I found the material really useful to remind myself that I need to keep a check on the noise in my mind. I need to make sure that I am following good time management and focusing habits.</p>

        <h3>What worked for you ?</h3>
        <p>To be frank I have not had the chance to try the new habits for too long. I might be able to revise this answer in a weeks time with some useful stats. I am very excited about the new writing habit, so will update the progress in a week.</p>

        <h3>Which will you experiment further with ?</h3>
        <p>I will definitely use the tiny habits method for cultivating more productivity habits.</p>
