        <p class="question">Introduction:</p>
        <p>Serendipity is 'luck that takes the form of finding valuable or pleasant things that are not looked for'. I believe that when someone desires something with utmost sincerity and authenticity they have the power to turn it into a reality and things just start manifesting in front of them and it might get defined as luck. I have been wanting to learn web development for a very long time,  and I found out about Enspiral Dev Academy on Friday the 11th of March and the first batch  in Auckland started on the 14th of March! Not just that I am on my Sabbatical till the 18th of July and the boot camp finishes on the 15th of July.</p>

        <p>I writing this reflection in a state of extreme excitement and exhilaration. It almost feels like this is my call to adventure and I am supported by incredible mentors and a group of passionate learners. The thing that excites me the most is that these mentors are also passionate about making this world a better place for everyone using their super power - Programming.</p>

        <p class="question">Whats your take on the DBC / EDA experience ?</p>
        <p>It has been a challenging and very rewarding start. I still can't believe that I already feel comfortable with Github and terminal after just one week!</p>

        <p class="question">What are your impressions ?</p>
        <p>I am thrilled to learn after my first week that staff at EDA are equally focussed on ethics, empathy and programming. This environment already feels like home to me.</p>

        <p class="question">How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture ?</p>
        <p>The culture that EDA has created is heavily focussed on the collective consciousness,co-creation and experimentation and I live by these philosophies every day. I already feel very supported by other learners in our cohort. I will try to contribute as much as I can to this experience.</p>

        <p class="question">Have your expectations of EDA changed ? If so, how ?</p>
        <p>Yes, my expectations have definitely changed. I believe that I will be able to achieve way more than what I anticipated before joining this course. There is a great sense of community within our cohort and the school in general. Everybody is at an arms reach to help you out when you need it.</p>

        <p class="question">Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment ? Does it make you nervous ?</p>
        <p>I am super excited to participate in this kind of learning environment. Yes, I was a bit nervous at the beginning but now that I know the support we have. I am only excited.</p>
